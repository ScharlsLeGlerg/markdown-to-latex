# markdown-to-latex

This will become a tool that converts an extended markdown syntax to latex.
For a later stage I plan to also support conversion to the ms makros for groff.

The original purpose of markdown was "Markdownâ€™s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web."[(Source)]
I want to alter that purpose to my needs, that is a easy markdown language for writing with the purpose of exporting to pdf.
Some features of my extended markdown synatax will include easy citing with biblatex (and later refer), more options for inserting images etc.
